#  Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains exercises from the **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** class â€” covering topics such as Python basics, data analytics, agents, and more.

---

##  Setup

Each folder contains its **own virtual environment** (`.venv`).
Before running any notebook or script, make sure to activate it:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Structure

* `01_python_basics/` â€” Intro to Python syntax and logic
* `02_data_analytics/` â€” Working with data and visualizations
* `03_data_analytics/` â€” Libs and tools for data manipulation
* `04_agents/` â€” AI agents and simple simulations

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* Always activate the correct `.venv` before running the notebooks.
* You can create new environments independently for each module if needed.
* Make sure your VS Code kernel points to the right interpreter.

To deactivate the venv:

```bash
deactivate
```
